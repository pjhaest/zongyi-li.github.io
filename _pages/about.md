I am honored to be a new PhD student with [Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima) 
in the [CMS department](href="http://cms.caltech.edu) at Caltech. 
I have a board interest in machine learning, theoretical computer science, and applied math.
Recently I have been working on developing graph neural networks for partial differential equations.   

I was an undergrad at Washington University in St. Louis, 
double-majoring in computer science and mathematics, 
I was privileged to be advised by [Brendan Juba](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~bjuba/) and [Xiang Tang](https://www.math.wustl.edu/~xtang/).
